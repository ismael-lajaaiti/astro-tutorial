            I seek to understand what makes a community of interacting species
            stable in the face of disturbances. To do this, I study how the
            complex web of interactions among species shapes their responses to
            different types of disturbances, from short-term events to long-term
            changes. My goal is to uncover how species' responses are connected:
            for instance, are species that are sensitive to short-term
            disturbances also vulnerable to long-term changes? Additionally, I
            want to see how these relationships vary depending on the type of
            interactions within the community, such as whether they differ
            between competitive, mutualistic, or trophic communities. I approach
            these questions using a combination of mathematical and numerical
            tools.
