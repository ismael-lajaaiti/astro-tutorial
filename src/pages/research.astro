                We know that some species are more resistant to disturbances
                than others—my aim is to understand why. Since species don’t
                live in isolation but interact with many others, I focus on how
                these biotic interactions shape their sensitivity. I also
                explore whether species sensitive to one type of disturbance are
                also at risk from others. For example, are species sensitive to
                short-term disturbances also vulnerable to long-term changes?
                Lastly, I investigate how the type of interactions between
                species—whether competitive, facilitative, or trophic—affects
                the relationships between their responses to different
                disturbances.
